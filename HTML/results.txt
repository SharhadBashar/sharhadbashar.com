Datasets of sizes: 
1. actual sizes of background and class present in each image
2. 10 bins, where each object of each class is put in a bin based on the % of image they take up
3. 50% background, and 50% spread out amongst the classes present

Loss functions used:
1. Sal_loss: from the paper
2. Class_loss: from the paper
3. Size_loss: loss functions I implemented. There are 2 size loss functions:
			  Size_loss_1: (t_i^n - size_i^n)^2 
			  Size_loss_2: penalty loss function. penalize if t_i^n is less than a or greater than b
			  For the exact loss function equations, please refer to Loss 1 and Loss 2 here: http://sharhadbashar.com/HTML/mastersThesis.html

Tests:
1.  Sal_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 1
2.  Sal_loss + class_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 1

3.  Sal_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 2 0.5804
4.  Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 2 This gave the bext result at miou = 0.6010

5.  Sal_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 3 miou = 0.4714
6.  Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 3 miou = 0.5023

7.  Sal_loss + Size_loss_2 on dataset 1
8.  Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_2 on dataset 1 

9.  Sal_loss + Size_loss_2 on dataset 2 
10. Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_2 on dataset 2 0.5855

11. Sal_loss + Size_loss_2 on dataset 3
12. Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_2 on dataset 3 0.4826

13. Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 3, recomputing size after every 2 epoch miou = 0.5328
14. Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 3, recomputing size after every 1 epoch miou = 0.5582
15. Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_1 on dataset 3, recomputing average size after every 1 epoch; new_size = (new_size + old_size) / 2 miou = 0.5456

16. Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_2 on dataset 3, recomputing size after every 1 epoch, where a and b are dynamic miou = 0.5423
17. Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_2, recomputing size after every 1 epoch, where a and b are static at a = 0.15 and b = 1 miou = 0.1187

18. Sal_loss + Size_loss_2, where a and b are static at a = 0.15 and b = 1 miou = 0.0982
19. Sal_loss + Class_loss + Size_loss_2, where a and b are static at a = 0.15 and b = 1 miou = 0.1955
